//! Process memory ledger.
//!
//! Subsystems report bytes in a fixed set of classes. A charge that would pass
//! its class ceiling or the process total is refused with
//! [`FaultCode::ResourceLimit`](crate::FaultCode::ResourceLimit) and does not
//! change the recorded usage. Work that can wait keeps the demand and retries
//! on a later frame. The ledger keeps only as many waiting demands as its
//! retained limit; a full list refuses the new demand and leaves the records
//! already kept unchanged.
//!
//! [`MemoryLedger::eviction_plan`] names rebuildable residents to drop under
//! pressure, farthest meshes first. Charges in the world class stay on the
//! ledger until their owner releases them. Memory pressure must not delete
//! committed world state.
//!
//! The ledger is an account. It does not replace the process allocator, trace
//! individual allocations, share a heap across processes, or sandbox native
//! code. Saving a world and advancing the simulation tick do not consult it.
